# PlotData - Web application for creating data visualizations

This web application is a fork of the [capstone-plotdata](https://github.com/catdieval/capstone-plotdata) **project developed as a team by me, [Maria Adner](https://github.com/MariaAdner) and [Yavor Lalev](https://github.com/YavorLalev)** during our [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en) web development course. It is written in **React.js and Next.js**.

**The current project is a further development of the fork on my own**.

With PlotData you can easily make customizable publication-quality charts, all without programming skills. You can upload a csv file and walk through the different steps to generate a chart, with the help of the [JavaScript Plotly library](https://plotly.com/javascript/basic-charts/). Also you can update the chart with new values and export it as png file for use in reports or presentations.

A csv test file *data.csv* is available in the repo for developers.
